      In this project I developped a component that can be attached to any actor.
      This component allows actors to be interacted by a player and be inspected, which means the player is able to rotate the actor to see it in further detail.
      Not only does this component help the player appreciate little details in objects 
      but it also gives artist and designers the opportunity to hide easter eggs, hidden secrets or clues behind props that would normally be just decoration.
      Controls:
      E to Inspect items.
      Right click to Stop Inspecting items.
